    <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
    <img src="images/me-seaside.jpg" alt="This is supposed to be a picture of me">
    <p>I have always had a passion for computers and technology. As a child I was fascinated by how computers worked and even built a few myself. 
      But it seemed more like a hobby and less like a career option for me at the time. I joined the Navy when I was 20 and served as a sonar technician on submarines.
      As a sonar technician I got to work with auxiliary computer systems that processed acoustic data into digital information for analysis. 
      After leaving the Navy I had a couple jobs working with engineering teams at manufacturing facilities to improve processes and conduct research & development testing for new and 
      existing products. I enjoyed the work but the pay wasn't great and upward mobility was almost non-existent. If I wanted a better job I needed to go back to school. 
      I used my GI bill to pursue a degree in computer science with a focus on software engineering. However, progress was slow and, because I was not using the information everyday, 
      I was beginning to forget a lot of what I had learned. That is when I decided to quit my job to fully immerse myself into learning programming. By attending the Digital Crafts 
      coding boot camp I hope to gain the skills needed to obtain a job related to software engineering.
